# Introduction
Employees are the backbone of any company, management of employee performance plays a major role in deciding the success of the organization. The current system running in the workshop is paper based. That is the workshop is still using cabinet files to store records of stock and employee information. Useful data is scattered all over the place. In this chapter we shall discuss the solutions to the problems being caused by the current system. We shall try to understand the manager’s expectations of the new system we are to develop for him. 


# Research

There are 100s and 1000s of employees working in companies and compare to those numbers, the strengh of staff and management is way less. Pen-paper based management of employee record is feasible and was in existence in past and is still in practice in some rural areas but with increase in number of youths, it has become very time consuming and labourous task. Records which are maintained for future help becomes a source of stress.
People have different personalities and work ethics .So in order to manage their work efficiently and fairly, there has to be a system in place to allocate tasks to different workers. Currently a manual system is used in the Rwandan business that will provide most of the requirements for this project. The system used in companuy is based on “TRUST” the employer trusts the employees. Althoughnoble the manager has little it control over his business. In a manual system data is stored in a cabinet. Files are thus often misplaced or lost. And at times is difficult to find relevant files. Records for stocks are also not always filed correctly and thus information is not centralised and not easily accessible.

Automated Employee Record System helps to avoid those issues. Employee Record System refers to a number of efficient automated systems designed for recording student data and perform functions like display, modify, delete, update save etc. Some Student Record Systems are made for general purpose while some Student Record System are made for specific purpose like exam performance records, progress records etc.

# Where
The problem is present in this globe.

# When
The problem has been around for decades but it was the only option in absence of computers and automated systems but advancement in technologies and its availability at most places has reduced the problem to greater extent.

# How
The problem was known because of the inconvinience it caused to staff, management and other people related to it. If not solved, it can cause a large technology gap which will eventually cause a delay in coping up with the new emerging automated systems along with other existing issues of the manual systems.
